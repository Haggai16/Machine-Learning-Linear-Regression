## Linear Regression Project
This project showcases my skills in data analysis and machine learning, specifically focusing on linear regression. The project involves using linear regression to analyze and predict outcomes based on the provided dataset.

## Project Overview
The Linear Regression Project aims to build a linear regression model to understand the relationship between the features and the target variable in the dataset. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features that potentially influence the target variable. The exact features and target variable will be detailed in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Analysis and Visualizations
In this project, I performed the following analyses and visualizations:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Correlation analysis to understand relationships between features and the target variable.
- Distribution plots and scatter plots to visualize data patterns.
3. Model Building and Evaluation:
- Building a linear regression model using training data.
- Evaluating the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
## Results
Some of the key findings from the analysis include:

- Correlation Analysis: Identified features that have a strong correlation with the target variable.
- Model Performance: The linear regression model's performance was evaluated, providing insights into its predictive power and accuracy.
